Now Feanor led the Noldor northward, because his first purpose was to follow 
Morgoth. Moreover Tuna beneath Taniquetil was set nigh to the girdle of Arda, 
and there the Great Sea was immeasurably wide, whereas ever northward the 
sundering seas grew narrower, as the wasteland of Araman and the coasts of 
Middle-earth drew together. But as the mind of Feanor cooled and took counsel 
he perceived over-late that all these great companies would never overcome the 
long leagues to the north, nor cross the seas at the last, save with the aid of ships; 
yet it would need long time and toil to build so great a fleet, even were there any 
among the Noldor skilled in that craft. He resolved now therefore to persuade the 
Teleri, ever friends to the Noldor, to join with them; and in his rebellion he 
thought that thus the bliss of Valinor might be further diminished and his power 
for war upon Morgoth be increased. He hastened then to Alqualonde, and spoke 
to the Teleri as he had spoken before in Tirion.
